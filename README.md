# Introduction
Welcome to Dashboard_Pro v1.0, a collaborative endeavor led by me and my exceptional team. Join us on this exciting journey as we unveil our innovative creation, a testament to our technical prowess, creativity, problem-solving abilities, and unwavering dedication. We invite you to delve into the world where technology and teamwork converge, powering the realization of this remarkable project. Prepare for an exhilarating experience!

# Requirements
- The client and the server shall not depend on a specific communication protocol.
- They shall be able to communicate to each other using TCP/IP and Serial & CAN protocols
- Max. speed is 240 km/h
- Temperature is in the range of [-60, 60] Â°C
- Battery level in percent.

# On the server GUI, there is a:
- A slider for speed. Speed is an integer in the range of 0 and 240.
- A slider for temperature. Temperature is an integer in the range of -60 and 60
- A slider for battery level. Battery level is an integer in the range of 0 and 100.
- Three checkboxes for the light signals:
- When left is checked, right shall be disabled and when right is checked, left shall be disabled.
- When warning is checked both the left.right checkboxes shall be disabled.
- When none of the checkboxes is checked, all of them shall be enabled

# On the client GUI there is a:
Simple dashboard to showcase real-time data, including speed, temperature, battery level, lighting signals, and the status of communication. Additionally, ensure it promptly alerts any communication problems between the client and server.

# Tools and Technologies Employed:

- **Version Control System / Continuous Integration**: Git and GitHub were utilized to monitor changes and facilitate collaboration throughout the software development process.

- **GUI Design and Sound Implementation**: Qt, a versatile cross-platform application framework, was chosen for creating graphical user interfaces and incorporating sound elements.

- **Project Configuration, Dependency Management, Builds**: CMake was employed to efficiently manage the build process for software projects. Visual Studio Code (VSC) served as the code editor for writing and debugging code. PlatformIO, an open-source ecosystem, was harnessed to streamline cross-platform development in embedded systems, simplifying project management for microcontrollers.

# Challenges Faced:

- Technical Compatibility Challenges: Dealing with team members using diverse operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS) introduced compatibility issues, particularly concerning synchronization of sound, graphical user interface (GUI), and port configurations.

- Testing Complexities: Ensuring the functionality of all components, especially within the context of Controller Area Network (CAN) communication, proved to be a complex task. CAN communication, with its support for multi-master setups and message-based protocols, posed unique testing challenges.

- Quality Assurance: Maintaining consistent code quality and guarding against regressions became challenging due to frequent updates from various team members. To address this, we implemented a form of continuous integration to prevent conflicts and uphold code quality standards.

- Learning Curve: The learning curve associated with adopting new tools, frameworks (such as Qt), and unfamiliar technologies during the project was time-intensive and temporarily impacted the pace of development.

To compile and execute both the client and server applications on the desktop, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory and navigate into it:
   ```
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

2. Configure the project using CMake, build it with 'make,' and run the server and client applications:
   ```
   cmake .. && make && ./server & ./client
   ```

**Note**: The default communication protocol utilized here is TCP (for network communication). If you wish to switch to the UART communication protocol, modify the 'CMakeLists.txt' file at line 7 as follows:

```cmake
set(USE_UART ON) #Change the ON to OFF
```

This will enable the UART communication protocol for your project.
